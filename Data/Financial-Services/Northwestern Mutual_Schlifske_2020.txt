Through a volatile and unpredictable 2020, Northwestern Mutual proved yet again that we stand strong for our clients throughout times of uncertainty.

In addition to supporting our policyowners and clients throughout the year, we achieved record business results, ultimately for your benefit. We welcomed more new clients than ever before, current policyowners stayed with Northwestern Mutual at the highest rate on record, and our team of financial professionals is now larger than ever. We are an investment leader—with a combined $500 billion invested through company and client assets to help people build long-term financial security. Plus, in 2021, our anticipated $6.2 billion1 total policyowner dividend payout will set a new record and again lead the industry.

For more than 160 years—and especially through these challenging times—our commitment to you is unwavering. Our approach to financial planning through a combination of insurance and investments helps you weather uncertainty while building financial security for the years ahead. 2020 is proof that the approach works.

Thank you for putting your trust in Northwestern Mutual. We are strong and growing, and our financial outlook is bright. Regardless of what happens in the world around us, you can count on Northwestern Mutual to be strong for you and your family for generations to come.
