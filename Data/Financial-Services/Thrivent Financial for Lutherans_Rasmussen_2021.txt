Dear Thrivent clients:

We’re pleased to share that 2021 was a remarkable year for Thrivent.

While we faced another year of pandemic challenges, Thrivent’s workforce showed up every day with courage and resilience. We kept our focus on what matters—you, our clients—as we accelerated our efforts to serve you and generations to come with holistic financial advice.

Thrivent’s assets under management grew to $189 billion at year-end. We paid $286 million in dividends to clients who own eligible insurance products. We paid $1.8 billion in life and health insurance benefits, $561 million in guaranteed retirement income, and $859 million in benefits to annuity beneficiaries. Our adjusted surplus grew to $16.2 billion, the strongest capital position in Thrivent history, providing strength today and positioning Thrivent to consider new opportunities.*

We continued our transformation into a stronger organization. We launched our new Thrivent Mobile App. We talked to clients, studied industry trends, conducted research, and took big steps to better enable us to deliver personalized financial advice when, where and how you want it. We hired strong leaders to oversee our human resources, digital and technology, and growth and generosity divisions. In addition, on a Forbes list of America’s Best Insurance Companies in 2021, Thrivent ranked second in the term life insurance category.**

While the numbers are significant and the work is inspiring, even more important are the people behind them—the families we helped through COVID losses and challenges, the holistic financial needs we met, and the generosity we inspired.

You’ll read more below of how we’re focusing on what matters. It’s all part of our unwavering commitment to help you achieve financial clarity and live a life of meaning and gratitude. Thank you for trusting us to serve you.

Teresa J. Rasmussen 

President and CEO
