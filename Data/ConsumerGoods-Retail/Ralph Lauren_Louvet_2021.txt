Information concerning the matters to be considered and voted upon at the 2021 Annual Meeting is set out in the attached Notice of 2021 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement. DEAR STOCKHOLDER: The last year will be marked as particularly profound – with the world managing multiple crises across health, the economy and society all at once. While a backdrop none of us would have chosen, it has also been a time to focus on what matters most. At Ralph Lauren, our first and primary focus has been ensuring the safety and security of our teams. We are incredibly proud of and inspired by their resilience, commitment and ongoing passion for our brand – all while dealing with the many challenges of the past year. As we progressively emerge from the pandemic, we are a stronger business than when we came into it. Despite its disruptions, we fundamentally transformed the foundations of our Company in Fiscal 2021 – progressing on the goals we set out in our Next Great Chapter Strategic Plan to deliver sustainable long-term growth and value creation. We took decisive actions – specifically, we: • Elevated our brand, with 16 consecutive quarters of Average Unit Retail growth • Simplified our brand portfolio, licensing Chaps and announcing the planned sale of Club Monaco to focus on our core namesake brands • Increased marketing spend as a percentage of revenue, adding 4 million consumers across our direct-to-consumer network alone • Drove business model and supply chain innovation with the launch of The Lauren Look rental program and our Color on Demand platform, reducing the environmental impact of cotton dyeing • Repositioned each of our channels, including reducing off-price and non-elevating wholesale, while accelerating our shift toward direct-to-consumer and digital, with a focus on Connected Retail • Balanced our geographical footprint with further expansion of our business across Asia • Diversified our supply chain and continued to reduce lead times • Achieved material cost reductions, ultimately creating a leaner, more agile cost structure • Worked in new ways, including virtual showrooms and digital product creation • Made tangible progress across our Citizenship & Sustainability goals – deepening our commitments across diversity and inclusion, taking meaningful action to address systemic racism as well as launching our circularity strategy What’s more, we believe our brand and our Purpose are more relevant than ever, as the world embraces the kind of luxury we stand for – one marked by optimism, hope, love and togetherness. Together, with our lifestyle positioning and the breadth of our product portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to deliver value for our consumers and all of our stakeholders in Fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we look ahead, while the environment remains dynamic, we are clear on where we are headed. We are focused on becoming an even more elevated, more direct-to-consumer, more digital, more global and a more diverse, equitable and sustainable Company. Thank you for your ongoing support and continued interest in our Company. We look forward to engaging at our 2021 Annual Meeting.
