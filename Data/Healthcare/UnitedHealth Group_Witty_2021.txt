Dear Shareholder:

We cordially invite you to participate in our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Monday, June 7, 2021, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to affect millions of people, we will once again hold our Annual Meeting virtually.

Over the past, unprecedented year, our 335,000 team members have distinguished themselves through their unwavering commitment to the health and safety of the people we are privileged to serve and have worked to deliver on our mission of helping people live healthier lives and helping the health system work better for everyone.

We released our inaugural Sustainability Report in 2020 to provide clarity to our stakeholders on our practices and progress. These efforts support and strengthen our ability to further fulfill our mission.

As a shareholder of UnitedHealth Group, you play an important role in our company by considering and taking action on the matters set forth in the attached proxy statement. We appreciate the time and attention you invest in making thoughtful decisions.

Attached you will find a notice of meeting and proxy statement containing information about the items upon which you will be asked to vote and the meeting itself, including different methods you can use to vote your proxy, including by internet, telephone and mail.

Every shareholder vote is important, and we encourage you to vote as promptly as possible. Instructions on how to participate in the Annual Meeting are included in the proxy statement.
