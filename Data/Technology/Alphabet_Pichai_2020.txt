To our investors, 

You might expect a company’s year in review to open with big numbers: how many products we launched, how many consumers and businesses adopted those products, and how much revenue we generated in the process. And, yes, you will see some big numbers shared in the pages of this report and in future earnings calls as well, but 22-plus years in, Google is still not a conventional company (and we don’t intend to become one). And 2020 was anything but a conventional year. 

That’s why over the past 12 months we’ve measured our success by the people we’ve helped in moments that matter. Our success is in the researchers who used our technology to fight the spread of the coronavirus. It’s in job seekers like Rey Justo, who, after being laid off during the pandemic, earned a Google Career Certificate online and was hired into a great new career. And our success is in all the small businesses who used Google products to continue serving customers and keeping employees on payroll… in the students who kept learning virtually on Google Classroom… and in the grandparents who read bedtime stories to grandchildren from thousands of miles away over Google Meet. 

We’ve always believed that we only succeed when others do. And that success is only possible because of the incredible teams I have the privilege of leading across Alphabet. Teams who, over the past year — at home with kids on their laps and pets at their feet — never stopped working to deliver on our mission and our core pillars of helpfulness, trust, execution, and supporting our partners. Teams who continue to create sustainable financial value. Teams full of optimists who believe in technology’s ability to make things better for people and communities everywhere. 

In the pages of this report, you’ll read about some of the ways our products helped people, businesses, and communities adapt and recover. I hope they’ll inspire you as much as they inspire me.
